# Remote Access Setup

Access to the homelab and its services remotely (away from home network) enables remote development 
& access from anywhere in the world.

Remote access is enabled by placing my homelab server & devices of interest on a VPN network.

The VPN network and its maintenance is outsourced to [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/).

Tailscale server is not self-hosted, so all management is outsourced to the Tailscale company.

## Future vision

I wish to eventually self-host the VPN server, as opposed to relying on a closed-source service.
